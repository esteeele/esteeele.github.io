<p>Getting here from Tokyo was pretty straightforward, you can either get a bus or a train which both take about the same amount of time. I took the train because it was easier to fall asleep which I desperately needed after my long flight.</p>

<p>I think even after the whole trip Matsumoto might even have been my favourite place in Japan - I think the reasons were a (by Japanese standards) relaxed and laid back pace of life, beautiful surroundings and many old buildings surviving. It actually felt closest to a European Spa or Ski town, very chill and with some of the friendliest people I encountered in Japan.</p>

<p>The castle is probably the biggest draw if you’re just passing through, but I was mainly here to see the mountains.</p>

<p>It is quite unusual to have such a well preserved castle in Japan, both due to the Meiji era destruction of Japan’s feudal legacy, earthquakes and WW2 bombing so Matsumoto is one of the best ways to see a (mostly) original 17th century castle so close to Tokyo.</p>

<p>The Valley between the mountains</p>

<h3 id="kamikcohi">Kamikcohi</h3>

<p>Kamikochi is a mountain climbing and camping resort in some of Japan’s highest mountains. Its not really a town, more of a coach stop with some hotels used as a pit stop for hiking up the many mountain routes.</p>

<p>It’s extremely easy to do as a day trip from Matsumoto - you just go to the train station and buy a ticket. For some crazy reason you can’t buy a return and instead need to buy one when you get off the bus in Matsumoto (you go via a train then transfer to a bus). I think total it was about 8000 yen, which is £40 at the time I went which wasn’t unreasonable as its the main way for Kamikochi to make money off day trippers.</p>

<p>The Money Shot</p>

<p>The hike I did with a couple of fit young guys was up Mount Yake Dake. I should stress this was totally doable as a day hike <em>if you are already very fit</em> if you’re not used to walking or are not so fit right now, or there’s adverse weather I would suggest not doing this. Even for us we found the ascent pretty tiring, and the downhill was a bit of a knee destroyer. That being said this was a fantastic hike and the views from the top, as well as the friendliness of the people there was so lovely. I’d like to thank the guy from the hostel who carried a coffee making kit all the way up and made us all some delicious black coffee - superstar!</p>

<p>Back in Matsumoto there was even a bonus firework festival thrown which was free to enter with some live music and tasty food stalls which was a nice bonus! I was a little sad not to be able to spend more time there, but as a Japanese guy staying at the hostel pointed out there are mountains all over the world.</p>

<p>I would also really recommend <a href="https://www.couchpotatohostel.com/en/index.html">Couch Potato Hostel</a> as a place to stay with a lovely host and vibe.</p>

<h3 id="kiso-valleynakesendo">Kiso Valley/Nakesendo</h3>

<p>You can get to the Post Towns in the Kiso Valley very easily and pretty cheaply from Matsumoto. 
They’re definitely beautiful places but there’s not that much to do in them besides souvenir shopping. The history is that they were built to cater to travellers making the long walk between Kyoto and Edo/Tokyo in the Tokugawa Shogunate Era of Japan (1600-1850s).</p>

<p>Just based on hotel availability I stayed in a town called Nojiri on the path of the Nakesendo. At this point after several days of beautiful sunshine the weather turned extremely wet - wetter than anything I’d have experienced in the UK - just the force and the length of time it rained for were extremely unusual.</p>

<p>Staying in a more traditional hotel was pretty cool as well.

<p>Still this random town provided an absolutely beautiful hike when I walked to Magome via Nagiso and Tsumago.</p>

<p>I went an extremely long way - I was pretty much solidly walking from about 06:30 to 17:00 which was a little much, but the roads were mostly paved or very well maintained tracks so I made good progress. The wet weather got a little miserable - I mostly stayed dry enough but water pooled at the bottom of my backpack cover and made the inside wet. Be warned - prepare for absurd amounts of rainfall!</p>

<p>If I visited just one place I’d say Tsumago was my favourite post town, Magome got the most visitors wasn’t actually that beautiful and felt like it was straying into over-tourism with the extremely large numbers of tour groups. From a UK perspective it would be like going to Bibury in the Cotswolds - its not a fake village but it is just a living tourist trap.</p>

<p>Oh and the recommended hike of Magome -&gt; Tsumago at least when I did it was extremely busy - the photos of empty trails and pristine woodland are exaggerated. Not saying you wont get it, just that wasn’t my experience.</p>

<h3 id="in-summary">In summary</h3>

<p>This was an extremely approachable and fun outdoorsy start to the trip. Everything was pretty easy and with a bit of machine translation and sign language public transport was easy to navigate, reliable and fast. I don’t know if I’d recommend walking the whole Nakesendo as lots of Europeans were doing as there’s a lot of road walking seemingly but it was a cool thing to dip my toe into.</p>]]></content><author><name>Edmund Steele</name></author><category term="japan,travel" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the Autumn of 2024 I visited Japan, which is an awesome place to visit and the first stop along the way I went to was Matsumoto, Kamikochi and the Kiso Valley.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">LLM’s will probably be a component of a truly intelligent system, not the system itself</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/software/2024/02/25/llms-need-a-source-of-truth.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="LLM’s will probably be a component of a truly intelligent system, not the system itself" /><published>2024-02-25T18:41:18+00:00</published><updated>2024-02-25T18:41:18+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/software/2024/02/25/llms-need-a-source-of-truth</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/software/2024/02/25/llms-need-a-source-of-truth.html"><![CDATA[<p>LLMs, while amazingly useful in so many ways, lack a concept of truth that will hold them back unless combined with a system capable of discerning true information from hallucinations.</p>

<h3 id="the-idea-of-hallucinations-is-a-marketing-gimmick">The idea of “hallucinations” is a marketing gimmick.</h3>

<p>There is no hallucination and there is no true output. A LLM produces whatever is statistically likely - in contrast a fact is not statistically likely, a fact simply is.</p>

<p>I’ve seen so many news reports that after listing the upside of an LLM will list the downsides, and will often list a “tendency to hallucinate” as a drawback. No. This isn’t something that can be fixed by the LLM itself. Take arithmetic - an early problem with ChatGPT was its failure to add numbers together. Thankfully this was fixed down this line by sending maths looking questions to an actual calculator. GPT didn’t ‘learn maths’; someone just added a subsystem to bypass the LLM where it was appropriate to. To fix maths in an LLM you’d need enough data covering enough arithmetic questions written in everyday language to be built into the model. Or you could just use existing arithmetic logic - something computers were built to do.</p>

<p>So this is a flawed example. No-one needs or wants AI to do arithmetic, that’s been a solved problem for decades now. Where we are currently seeing problems is a misapplication of AI into roles where truth is expected.</p>

<h3 id="llms-are-not-search-engines">LLMs are not search engines</h3>

<p>I used to work with a publishing company that provided services around analysing textual data for example providing a specialist search engine. While I worked in the grubby web development team, I sat across a row of desks for the data science team. This was before the AI explosion from 2021 onwards but they were of course well aware of the developments of GPT-2 - and for the most part they understood it to be a tool for a different problem. It was understood that when someone requested data relating to a certain topic or existing content they wanted … well content related to that topic or term. They didn’t want content that <em>might</em> relate to their query.</p>

<p>We’ve already seen a legal case thrown out because a lawyer trusted a response from an LLM about a non-existent case. In most cases I imagine we’re already seeing lower impact damage from researchers and analysts making mistaken conclusions from inaccurate but correct sounding output.</p>

<h3 id="llm-chatbots">LLM chatbots</h3>

<p>This is more likely to be a flash in the pan as companies will quickly realise their mistake in allowing ChatGPT free rein to help their customers. Personally I find AI chatbots exceedingly irritating but I’ll imagine that will improve as GPT slurps up more data. Recently an LLM put one statistically likely foot in front of the other and invented a refund policy that the parent company had to honour.</p>

<p>This is exceptionally silly. An LLM should never have been allowed to start generating text related to a refund policy. The overall system should have detected the customer was asking about refunds and stepped in with a deterministic print out of the company’s official refund policy and probably a number to call for a human. This would imply the existence of a second regulating system on top of GPT that checks and controls inputs and outputs from the internal GPT model to ensure they make sense.</p>

<h3 id="my-002">My $0.02</h3>

<p>So in these 3 examples we need a mind outside of GPT that can verify its responses. For now that’s us but does it have to be? Could we build a machine that is itself endogenously capable of somehow knowing what is true and what isn’t? If you’re a materialist then the answer clearly is yes - because we as biological machines can already do it. The question is how? I know actually - <em>but I’ll only tell you for 7 trillion USD!</em></p>

<p>For now I think the answer is always remembering to verify anything that sounds like a fact from GPT, and for software use cases wrapping the GPT input/output away from direct external usage and carefully controlling the communication through programmed rules. Someday this may look like an anachronism but for now although GPT will inevitably get better and better as it consumes more data, it can never know what it is saying is true.</p>]]></content><author><name>Edmund Steele</name></author><category term="software" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[LLMs, while amazingly useful in so many ways, lack a concept of truth that will hold them back unless combined with a system capable of discerning true information from hallucinations.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Things I’ve learnt as a self taught software developer</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/software/2024/02/18/what-id-tell-a-younger-me.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Things I’ve learnt as a self taught software developer" /><published>2024-02-18T09:41:18+00:00</published><updated>2024-02-18T09:41:18+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/software/2024/02/18/what-id-tell-a-younger-me</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/software/2024/02/18/what-id-tell-a-younger-me.html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve now been a ‘self taught’ developer with 6 years professional experience. The process of reviewing graduate applications for my company has got me thinking about things that I’ve learnt coming into the industry and as I’ve gained more experience. I’ve got some groupings here that go beyond the non obvious stuff (know how to code)</p>

<h2 id="be-someone-people-want-to-work-with">Be someone people want to work with</h2>

<p>As a case study to illustrate this I’d like to talk about 2 people I’ve worked with previously. One was probably the best developer I’ve ever worked with, one was bang average. One rose through the ranks with amazing speed, one was borderline pushed out of their job. The difference? One of them was someone people liked working with.</p>

<p>To illustrate the point I had to visit Amsterdam to work for a period of time very early both in my career and in a new job, and I knew absolutely no-one there. Despite working in a totally different team Mr Soft Skills introduced himself and made sure to introduce me to the rest of the team (which my boss hadn’t bothered to do) took me to lunch and made sure I was settling in OK. It was genuinely such a small thing but the fact I still remember it so long after shows the impact these gestures can have. If everyone you work with has positive interactions like this with you it makes such a huge difference. This is something I personally sometimes struggle with - I’m quite proud and can sometimes get annoyed if condescended to or if dragged into something that’s not my responsibility.</p>

<h2 id="learn-the-theory">Learn the theory</h2>

<p>This is true if you haven’t done a CompSci or Software Engineering degree and is potentially true even if you have. While you’re starting a first job or as a junior it can be overwhelming so don’t always feel you have to work constantly. No-one ever expects you to immediately start producing like a senior developer but if you want to progress you will need to catch-up on things many of your colleagues will have learnt at university.</p>

<p>There’s some great resources out there, especially <a href="https://teachyourselfcs.com">TeachYourselfCS</a> and many free Youtube lecture series. In terms of importance my recommendations for areas of focus would be (from a BE developer perspective)</p>

<ol>
  <li>Learn another programming language in a different paradigm - e.g. if you know Python learn (some) Functional Programming, if you’ve only used Javascript learn some Java. This will stop you getting stuck in one way of thinking and broaden how you think about code in general.</li>
  <li>Databases - understand things like transaction isolation levels, broadly how query optimisation works and concurrency models. Schema design is very often the most critical part of application design, yet it is often overlooked by self taught developers.</li>
  <li>Algorithms and Data Structures. Initially this may seem like overkill but the wrong data structure choice can absolutely scupper an application.</li>
  <li>Networking - doesn’t have to be super in depth but knowing the basics of DNS/HTTP will serve you well in our distributed computing world.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="dont-be-picky-for-your-first-job">Don’t be picky for your first job</h2>

<p>If you don’t have a CS degree or any proven experience getting a first job is rough, especially at the time of writing. My only experience of programming before I got a job was writing Data Science-esque code at university in Python. My first job was writing a Spring Java monolith for a small Insurance company in my hometown where I lived with my Mum.</p>

<p>Was it glamorous or prestigious? No. Did I like Java? Eh. Did I enjoy it? Sometimes. Was it good for my career? To an almost absurd degree yes.</p>

<p>When you start working you’ll learn far more than by teaching yourself, generally if you’re enthusiastic your fellow engineers will be more than happy to talk to you about anything and everything. I learnt so much about low level programming, how to help out with sales calls, how to work with product managers, the list goes on. This is almost impossible to self learn. I actually feel bad for ‘kids these days’ that are going to miss out on working in person and learning this stuff through osmosis but do what you can.</p>

<h2 id="make-mistakes-and-learn-from-them">Make mistakes and learn from them</h2>

<p>The most successful developers I’ve worked with have invariably been ones who have put themselves forward for new projects and suggested their own. At some point you need to make bold decisions yourself and suffer the consequences. I’ve been responsible for some disasters in my time, but really - looking back on them - they were fairly minor incidents that everyone else forgot about in a day or two.</p>

<p>I’ll tell you what though - experiments that pay off can be some of the most rewarding things you can do. They’re really a win-win: either your company gets a cool new feature or you learn for the rest of your career why something is a bad idea! (This depends on working somewhere that sees problems as a learning experience and not a stick to beat someone with)</p>

<h2 id="you-are-not-your-code">You are not your code</h2>

<p>Negative feedback on code submissions can be upsetting but never take it personally. Fundamentally you are making a product for a company - it’s never ‘yours’. There’s nothing more frustrating than a Junior Developer defending crazy design decisions because they can’t bear to be ‘wrong’. Of course some PR reviewers can be nasty. I hope you don’t experience this.</p>

<p>Generally, especially early in your career if you disagree with a comment ask the reviewer to explain it in person. 9/10 you’ll learn something new, the other 1/10 will be developers unaware there’s a new and maybe better way to do something - this is your time to shine! See a PR review as a learning experience and bear in mind that you too will think the code you’re writing now is terrible in a few years time.</p>]]></content><author><name>Edmund Steele</name></author><category term="software" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve now been a ‘self taught’ developer with 6 years professional experience.
