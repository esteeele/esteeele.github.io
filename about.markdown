Hi, I'm Ed(mund)! I'm a London based software developer whose mainly worked with Java and cloud technologies across the publishing and financial sectors. I try and be as broad in my understanding of technology as possible seeking to understand the things I work on at a deeper level.

Thanks for reading my blog, it'll probably be a random collection of thoughts relating to 
engineering, culture and history. I've always believed the best way to understand something is to 
explain it to someone else. 

S/O to Github for hosting this for $free!
